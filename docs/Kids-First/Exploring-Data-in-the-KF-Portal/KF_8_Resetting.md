Clearing and Changing Queries
=============================

There are several ways to change your query.

Change the parameters of a filter
---------------------------------

If still want to filter by age range, but to use different ages, we
could do so in query bar by clicking the small arrow next to the age
range. A pop up with the same selection box we saw before will appear,
and let us change our selections:

`x` to the right of the filter description:

at the far right of the query line:
