    \#\#\#\# File Repository

    :   -   Now that we have a sense of what data is on KFDP, let\'s
            choose some data to work with.
        -   

            **The most important feature of data is whether or not you have access to it**

            :   -   Filter (top left) \--\> Browse All \--\> Access
                    \--\> Click \"Open\" \--\> View Results
                -   Now we are searching exclusively Open data

        -   Let\'s select some data from the **Pediatric Brain Tumor
            Atlas: Childrens\' Brain Tumor Tissue Consortium (CBTTC)**
        -   You will see that we can choose Clinical Filters and/or File
            Filters
        -   First, lets choose *Cancer* from \"Diagnosis Category\" and
            *High Grade Glioma* from \"Diagnosis\" from Clinical
            Filters.
        -   That\'s enough Clinical Filters for now. Let\'s see what
            this returns for us in terms of available files. *It\'s
            important to not get too specific until we know what\'s
            available.*
        -   Under File Filters, we see two types of \"Experiment
            Strategies\", WGS and RNASeq. Click each one at a time and
            see how the File Filter categories below change.
