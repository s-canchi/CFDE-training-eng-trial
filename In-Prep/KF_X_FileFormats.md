\#\#\#\# File Format Sidebar: \* I want to go over what data/file types
are associated with what type of analysis \* I also want to go over what
file types can actually be used for further downstream analysis \*
Example, the RNASeq data returns .tsv, .pdf and \"Other\" \* ie: all
files returned are not going to be useful in Cavatica, but may be useful
in other ways
