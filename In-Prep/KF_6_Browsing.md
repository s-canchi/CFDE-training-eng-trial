Browsing the Portal
===================


Now that we're all connected, let's explore KFDP. Our goal is twofold:
(1) Find data that is of interest to us, and (2) Get that data onto
Cavatica

<https://portal.kidsfirstdrc.org/explore>

Dashboard Overview
==================

Once you're logged in, you should see a screen with these six boxes.
Depending on what data you are authorized to use, your boxes may have
more or less information in them:

![**Kids First Dashboard.**](../../images/KidsFirstPortal_11.png)

!!! Tip

    If you are logged in and don't see this screen, click on the Kids First
    logo (top left) to get back to the Portal Dashboard.


This Dashboard view is designed to give you a way to quickly get back to
work if you left off in the middle of a project.

Since we have not started portal, let's start with the bottom row. The
categories on this row are generalized to the KFDP as a whole. You'll
notices each topic has an associated graphic. Mouse over each of the
graphics below to get an idea of what is studied using KFDP: \*
Studies/Participants \* Member Research Interests \* Most Frequent
Diagnoses

Now let's look at the top row. Here we see information specific to your
own portal experience. \* Saved Queries \* Authorized Studies \*
Cavatica Projects

NOTE: \#\#\#\# \"About the Portal\" \* Why is this such a tiny button in
the middle of nowhere? There's some good stuff in here, but users are
unlikely to click on it.
