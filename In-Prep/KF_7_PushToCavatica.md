Push To Cavatica
================

\#\#\#\# Selecting Files and Pushing Files to Cavatica \* We are
currently looking at data under the CBTTC. The data has the following
features: \* Cancer \* Patients diagnosed with high grade glioma \*
RNASeq \* Under the File Filter \"File Format\" choose .tsv \* On the
main screen, scroll to the bottom and select the number of files you
wish to view at one time \* On the main screen, click the small box to
the left of \"File ID\" to select all of the .tsv files \* Now the
exciting part! Click the large purple **\"ANALYZE IN CAVATICA\"** button

    We see a dialogue box pop up. In this case, we are authorized to copy all 100 files we selected, but we need a Cavatica project to assign them to.

    :   -   Click \"+ Create a project\" and name your project \"{Last
            name} practice lesson\"

\*Note: can currently only copy the files to Cavatica that you have
selected. So, if you have 400 files, but can only select the first 100,
you will have to copy 100 files at a time.

\*Note: There is a message button that pops up that says the files were
transferred successfully. But I haven\'t been successful yet.

\#\#\#\# Confirm KF data can get onto Cavatica \* Log onto Cavatica,
navigate to your project and look for your files. Do you seem them? \*
This is currently a problem \* Last night my 100 RNASeq .tsv files
didn\'t transfer (again) \* FAQ guidance: In Cavatica \--\> click name
(upper right) \--\> account settings \--\> dataset access \* Look for
green check mark next to KF \* I currently have a red X. Not sure who to
contact to change this to a green check mark. \* There appear to be
CBTTC files in Cavatica but are not the same as on KFDP. For example,
the RNASeq files are now bam files.
