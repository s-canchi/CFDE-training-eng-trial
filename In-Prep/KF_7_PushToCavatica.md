Push to Cavatica
================

Before you start, check your KidsFirst settings (under you name on the top right) to make sure Data Repository Integrations are connected. Your screen should look like this:

![**KFDRC Portal Settings Page.**](../../images/kf_settings_10.png)

Then go back to your File Repository tab. We are currently looking at data under the CBTTC. The data has the following filters.

Clinical Filters:

Diagnosis Category --> Cancer
Diagnosis (Source Text) --> high grade glioma

![**Clinical Filters**](../../images/Clinical_Filters_11.png)

File Filters:

Experiment Strategy --> RNA-Seq
File Format --> tsv

![**File Filters**](../../images/File_Filters_12.png)

On the main screen, scroll to the bottom and select the number of files you wish to view at one time (see blue circle in the clinical filters image above).

There are a total of 405 files available with these filters. Select the files you wish to analyze in Cavatica by checking the box next to File ID.

!!! Important
    You can only view a maximum of 100 files at a time, so if you wish to push individual files across multiple pages, you would have to perform the pushing process multiple times.

    If you want to push ALL available files, leave all file IDs unchecked. For the purposes of this tutorial, let's leave the boxes unchecked.

Then click the large purple **\"ANALYZE IN CAVATICA\"** button.

 A message box pops up. In this case, we are authorized to copy 399 (out of 405) files. You need a Cavatica project to assign the files to. Click "Create a project" and name your project "{Last name} practice lesson".

 ![**Create a Cavatica Project**](../../images/cavatica_project_created_13.png)

 A message pops up for a few seconds that says the files were transferred successfully. Click on "Open project in Cavatica".

 If the pop-up message disappears before you can get to it, <visit www.cavatica.org> on a new tab and scroll to the bottom of the page. Click the "ACCESS DATA" button.

 ![**ACCESS DATA**](../../images/access_data_14.png)

 Log in to Cavatica with your ERA commons ID (or whichever ID you used to link your Cavatica account to KidsFirst)

![**Cavatica login**](../../images/cavatica_login_15.png)

 Your Cavatica homepage should look something like this after login:

![**Cavatica homepage**](../../images/cavatic_homepage_16.png)

 Click on your project and then click on the Files option next to Dashboard on the top left of the screen.

 ![**Cavatica homepage**](../../images/cavatica_metadata_17.png)


All our files copied over! Hurray!

On this page, you can customize the view-able metadata options by clicking the table icon (see blue circle on above figure) on the right side of the page.

You are now ready to start data analysis!
